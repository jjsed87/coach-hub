          <h3>Atlanta/Falcons</h3>
          <p><strong>Scheme:</strong> Counter (Backside Guard & Tackle/Wing Pull)</p>
          <p><strong>Personnel:</strong> 10 / 11 (Adjust as needed)</p>
          <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identify the Mike Linebacker (First linebacker at 3-5 yards depth in the box play side).</li>
            <li>Backside Guard pulls, play-side tackle/wing lead.</li>
            <li>"Wall-Street" call indicates Wing pulls, Tackle hinges.</li>
            <li>Play-side Tackle covers "-1" (backside LB) if no B-gap threat; otherwise, the Guard covers if his A-gap isn’t threatened.</li>
            <li>Center picks up backside A and B gaps when there’s no hinge call.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Running Back (RB):</strong> Follow the pulling guard’s kick-out or log. Read the guard’s block: cut inside if the kick-out works or bounce outside if the defender spills.</p>
          <p><strong>Quarterback (10 Personnel):</strong> Read the backside C-gap defender if there is no hinge call (Wall-Street).</p>
          <h4>Key Calls / Communication</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wall-Street:</strong> Indicates that the Wing is pulling and the play-side tackle must hinge.</li>
            <li><strong>Mike ID:</strong> Identify which linebacker is Mike. The second puller’s block is keyed to the Mike’s read – insert if open, or bounce if not.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="mid-zone-run">
          <h3>Mid Zone Run</h3>
          <p><strong>Formation:</strong> 10 or 11 Personnel</p>
          <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Zone Blocking – Mid Zone Read</p>
          <p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Everyone blocks his “zone” or gap. It is like a dance; we must be in unison together.</li>
            <li>Use your backside hand on the play-side gap defender’s breastplate.</li>
            <li>Block square and run through the defender.</li>
            <li>If the defender spikes inside, adjust and redirect your block inside. (This is why we stay square.)</li>
            <li>Combo blocks happen when you are uncovered play-side but covered backside. Goal should be to turn the defender's shoulders so your teammate can overtake.</li>
            <li>The running back’s aiming point (from pistol): the outside leg of the play-side tackle. Find the bubble in the defense.</li>
            <li>RB should make his cut within the first 3 steps.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Running Back (RB) Rules</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Target is the outside leg of the play-side tackle.</li>
            <li>Cut is within the first 3 steps.</li>
            <li>Watch the block: if the defender is driven outside, cut inside; if the block holds tight, bounce outside.</li>
            <li>In an even front, read the block of the play-side 1 or 3 tech. If you bang inside the tackle, a natural cutback is possible with the backside tackle creating the lane.</li>
            <li>Trust the O-line to create your running lane.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Notes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Block your assigned gap. In your play-side gap, use your backside hand on the defender’s breastplate.</li>
            <li>Stay square—keep your body in front of the defender and do not overreach.</li>
            <li>When the defender spikes inside, be square and run and continue to drive with his momentum.</li>
            <li>Communicate with your teammates at the line—make sure every gap is covered.</li>
            <li>Bubble: The area where a defense has nobody on the line of scrimmage play side (e.g., the B gap if running towards a 1 technique in an even front).</li>
            <li>Be decisive.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Pass Protections</h2>
          <h3>Black = Slide Left (6-Man Protection)</h3>
          <h3>Purple = Slide Right (6-Man Protection)</h3>
          <p><strong>Personnel:</strong> 10 Personnel (5 OL + 1 RB)</p>
          <p><strong>Concept:</strong> Half-Slide Protection (Zone/Man Combo)</p>
          <h4>Pass Protection Rules & Responsibilities</h4>
          <p><strong>Slide Side (Black = Left / Purple = Right):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each OL on the call side is responsible for their outside gap.</li>
            <li>Step toward your slide side; block what shows in your gap. <strong>EYES</strong></li>
            <li>If uncovered, help your neighbor inside-out. <strong>KEEP EYES ON SLIDE GAP</strong></li>
            <li>Communication is key: call out "twist," "out," or help needed. <strong>EYES MAKE THIS EASY</strong></li>
            <li>Tackles: don't be afraid to over-set knowing you have inside help.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Man Side (Backside of Slide Call):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Backside Tackle: Always man on. Protect <strong>INSIDE</strong>. Don't over-set!</li>
            <li>Backside Guard:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If covered (1, 2i, 3, 4i), block that defender man-to-man.</li>
              <li>4i: communicate to tackle an outside threat.</li>
              <li>If uncovered, you are part of the slide.</li>
              <li>Vertical sets with eyes inside. Block inside threat first.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Center:</strong></li>
            <ul>
              <li>Start the slide in the direction of the call.</li>
              <li>Declares the "Mike" or point LB pre-snap.</li>
              <li>Keeps eyes on any potential late pressure crossing face.</li>
              <li>Center can break the slide and work to the backside A.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Running Back:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Alignment on either side in gun (switch up).</li>
            <li>Responsible for the most dangerous linebacker on the man side, as pointed out by the center.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Coaching Points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Slide side: protect your play-side gap. Move together.</li>
            <li>Man side: don't get beat inside. Take your man.</li>
            <li>RB: check inside first, then help wide.</li>
            <li>Center: communicate clearly and often.</li>
            <li>Finish your blocks. Don’t chase, pass off stunts.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Formations</h2>
          <p><strong>Overview:</strong> We run a basic spread offense with 10, 11, and 12 personnel. These formations allow us to create space and attack defenses both in the run and pass game.</p>
          <h3>2x2 Formation</h3>
          <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Two receivers on each side of the formation. Can be run with or without a tight end.</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wide Receivers (WRs): Align outside the numbers or in the slot, depending on the play call.</li>
            <li>Tight End (TE): If present, aligns on the line of scrimmage, typically on the strong side.</li>
            <li>Running Back (RB): Aligns in the backfield, offset to the quarterback in shotgun.</li>
            <li>Quarterback (QB): Reads the defense pre-snap to identify coverage and potential blitzes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This formation is balanced and versatile, allowing for quick passes, inside zone runs, and RPOs.</p>
          <h3>3x1 Formation</h3>
          <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Three receivers on one side and one on the other. Can be run with or without a tight end.</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wide Receivers (WRs): Three receivers align on the strong side, with one isolated on the weak side.</li>
            <li>Tight End (TE): If present, aligns on the strong side, often in-line or flexed out.</li>
            <li>Running Back (RB): Aligns in the backfield, offset to the quarterback in shotgun.</li>
            <li>Quarterback (QB): Reads the defense pre-snap to identify mismatches and coverage rotations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Notes:</strong> This formation creates mismatches and spacing advantages, ideal for quick passes, outside zone runs, and play-action passes.</p>
